## Tastekeeper

Tastekeeper is a PWA for keeping track of things you have tasted. The user can add new treats to the database with various metadata and then add review of the product, the other users of the app can also add reviews to all previously added products. The primary goal is to replace the use of Excel for keeping track of various treats I have tried.

### Tech Stack

The project has SPA frontend and Node based backend. Redis and PostgreSQL are used to store the data. Currently Redis is used for "less persistent" data such as email verification tokens. In future it will used for caching, rate limiting etc.
